With day 43 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did OK, considering it was a long-haul day. We moved out of the woodsy cabin and made it back to our house in the green heart of Holland. I got to 10,000 steps, ate well enough, and even got my exercise done. I did not run, however. I have to run again soon here!

## Highlight of the day?

I got to put in my "Eastern Daylights Saving" time zone day from Gouda, which was fun. Working in a cute little cafe named [Bagels and Beans](https://goo.gl/maps/pPuxyzWXZzx) is a nice change of pace. Plus taking the bus and walking into Gouda Central is always pleasant for me. Quintessential Dutch.

## How do I feel?

Feeling well, all things considered. I could be doing better. Need to run!
