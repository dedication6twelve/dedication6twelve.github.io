With day 30 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Not great.

No.

I did walk a lot of steps though (over 18,000) because I had to journey back from returning a rental car and there was one three mile stretch I hiked.

But, I didn't do great. A lot of not so great food. Need to turn it around. Vacation or not. Otherwise, what am I doing here? There is no integrity to this project.

## Highlight of the day?

Seeing the kids discover the wave pool was pretty impressive. OK, I enjoyed it too. ðŸ¤—

(Full disclosure: chilling in the pool or poolside without a shirt on is still pretty nightmarish for me. It helps to be a little smaller, but I'm still big. It's not fun for me. But I just swallow the thoughts and focus on the kids. I'm there for them. And their smiles cover all gaps.)

## How do I feel?

Feeling good, despite the weak showing on the project. I'm on vacation. I want to relax and enjoy it. I will be working again remotely, and then things can be and feel different. But for now, I just want to keep every moment, bottle it up, and have it at the ready to let out and feel all the sensations again. Being here is extraordinary.

## Bonus content: Netherlands countryside

I walked a lot today. In fact, I walked from one village to another. Here are some photos I snapped along the way.
