With day 7 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

It's still weekend, so still relaxed. Father's Day brought all sorts of naughty things (😉) into my life. Nevertheless, I had my salad (a salad a day!), and I got my 10k steps in. A good active day. I also got a "Perfect Week" badge from my Apple Watch for seven straight days of completing my activity circles every day. Fun! A good day to enjoy the family and the life I'm building.

## Highlight of the day?

My children waking me up early with loud "HAPPY FATHER'S DAY" chants, admittedly so I can set up the Nintendo Switch for them to play. Ahhh, kids. 😜 Don't they know they should let their father sleep in? FAT CHANCE OF THAT! 😉

Beyond their lovely faces, a letter my eldest daughter wrote to me was particularly touching. In cursive and rather neat handwriting, I know it must have taken her a long time to do. An act of love so pure, it brought me to tears.

My children should probably be the highlight of every day - but on this day, it came a little more to the fore than is usual.

## How do I feel?

Feeling full! I've had a lot to eat this weekend. Haha! But my alarm is already set for 5:45AM. I'm ready for Week 2 of Dedication 6/12 to begin in full force. BRING IT!! 🏋️
