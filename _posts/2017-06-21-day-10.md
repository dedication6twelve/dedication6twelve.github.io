With day 10 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Today went great! Started with my run doing a tweak on my method - once I got to my 10-minute run interval, I instead did a five 1:30-:30 Run/Walk intervals, pushing really hard during the 1:30 portion. The result was a faster-than-expected pace and a pretty good high from the interval training. I'm totally going to do this from now on! Also, of course, was the diet - and I knocked it out of the ballpark again today - including the ever tempting HAPPY HOUR I had with my colleagues. I allowed myself an [old fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Fashioned). But as planned, I ate plenty before (of the good things) and sipped on the one drink the whole night. It was great. And of course, having a ridiculous super-food lunch (Kale/Quinoa) helps a ton!

## Highlight of the day?

Today was a good day on the highlight front!

It started with an excellent run workout. 🏃

Followed by a wonderful happy hour where we could get together and have some fun - without compromise!! 🍸🎉

There was this encouragement from one of my teammates 😊:

> "Today I choose to go to management/lead session at Velocity conference,
> and I feel really happy knowing that what you've been doing in the last
> year is what the people are looking for. I feel fortunate to be part of
> your team."

And finally this encouragement on the [#dedication6twelve](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dedication6twelve?src=hash) front:

Feeling good. Feeling strong. 60 more days to go. I got this.
