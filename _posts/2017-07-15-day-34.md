With day 34 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did OK today with my food choices. Big breakfast again, followed by healthy lunch, and then light bites the rest of the way.

But the diet didn't steal the show today. It was the activity. I've logged over 23,000 steps for the day. It was a fun, active day. Lots of hiking, a 5K run (in 40 minutes, but it included off-road paths that slowed me down, so I was happy with the performance), and lots of swimming and playing with the children in the pool. Running up stairs to go on the big water slide. Over and over again.

Good day. (And I'm exhausted!)

## Highlight of the day?

Seeing one of my twins, Olivia, four years of age, not shy away from the lazy river and big water slide, typically reserved for teenagers and up. Brave little girl!

(I need a waterproof case for my phone to snap some photos!)

## How do I feel?

I feel lively, active. Today was not for the faint of heart. I have a healthy heart. I'm thankful for all the wonderful memories we're building.
