With day 8 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Strong day today. Was able to bounce back strong from a relaxed weekend. I ran. I ate right. Even with Krispy Kreme donuts within my reach (treat for the kids from Bettina), it was easy to not indulge. I had little desire for it. I was never hungry today, I ate all the right things and drank all the necessary water. A strong day!

## Highlight of the day?

Seeing a text message from Bettina showing me a picture of Sofia (my 7-year-old) missing a tooth that apparently Sofia pulled out herself. That was funny. Bettina wasn't too happy but I was proud. Good for her!

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. Full! I'm happy with my progress. Another day in the books. Just 62 days to go. One day at a time.
