With day 54 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Today was not a good day on the project front. No exercise and poor diet.

I had a chance to run this morning as I had intended. But because of a series of unfortunate events, I skipped the morning run in favor of an evening run that never happened.

Tomorrow is a new day.

## Highlight of the day?

It was an uneventful day today. I worked most of the day. Either for my family or the [company we're building](https://plxis.com).

We did take an hour to quickly run over to the Albert Heijn in [Goverwelle](http://www.winkelcentrumgoverwelle.nl/view/1/Home.html) to buy some groceries. That was fun albeit brief. That will have to count for today.

1. The seasons (rain/snow/sun)
1. Summers that aren't as hot
1. Long summer days (and long winter nights)
1. Being ahead of East coast (habits of successful people, without waking up quite as early)
