With day 32 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did better today. Spent the morning waiting around a single pair of washer/dryer (for a whole campground!) so little opportunity for bad food. Then I chilled at the bungalow while watching Stage 12 of the Tour de France. Best last 500m in a while, thanks, Bettina! After that, did some hiking with the four younger children, including a real-life maze! Pretty fun. And I finished the night with another hike in the woods while Bettina put kids in bed. (Thanks again, Bettina!)

A lot of movement. Ready to run tomorrow.

Diet was decent.

## Highlight of the day?

The highlight of the day is seeing my kids have fun at the maze. So much fun!

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. So nice to take some time off. ðŸ‘¯
