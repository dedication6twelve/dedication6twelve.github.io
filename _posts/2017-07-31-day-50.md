With day 50 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did well today. I didn't run, but I walked 5 kilometers over 50 minutes - a relatively quick average pace. Diet was very much metered. A beautiful Monday, and 50th day of this journey.

## Highlight of the day?

A simple walk in the evening to reach 10k steps provided some beautiful, sweeping vistas of the Dutch landscape at dusk. The weather was beautiful.

## How do I feel?

I am feeling good. 50 days! 20 to go.

Didn't run but that's OK. Walking for 50 minutes feels almost better. But I do like running!

Tomorrow I run.
