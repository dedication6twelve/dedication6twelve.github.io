With day 52 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did OK today. Diet was a little worse than usual - my daughter's 10th birthday was today - and I also didn't do any exercise. But I did reach 10,000 steps, and I had a rather active day just walking around The Hague with the kids early on.

## Highlight of the day?

Celebrating my daughter's birthday was great! From early surprise decorations and gift unwrapping, through visiting The Hague together as a family, to sharing some [gebakjes](https://www.google.nl/search?q=gebakjes), singing "Happy Birthday," and even bursting open a pi√±ata! Quite a festive day indeed.

## How do I feel?

I feel delighted and blessed to share a life with my daughter. I'm very proud to be her father and her friend. A beautiful day today.
