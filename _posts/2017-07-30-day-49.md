With day 49 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

After yesterday's disappointment, the first thing I did today was go walk 5 km. üòÇ I have over 16k steps for the day.

Diet was good, too. Even though it's weekend, I've been muted on the food front. It's harder to eat high quantities of bad in the Netherlands. It takes a bit more of "out of your way" movement and there are a lot of choices here for some [lekker en gezond eten](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/lekker%20en%20gezond%20eten).

## Highlight of the day?

Went to Utrecht with the whole family today. Lots of fun.

Second place: Also got a chance to steal a few moments of one-on-one time (sort of, Anabella was with us) with Bettina. We were even stuck at a train station together because of heavy sudden rains making it difficult to get to the car. I didn't mind. It was kind of romantic. Ahh, Europe. üòç

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. Ready to run run tomorrow. I do my 30 minute run/walk program, but I don't count my warm up and cool down sessions any more. So that means 15 x 1.5 min run, 0.5 min walk. Bring it!
