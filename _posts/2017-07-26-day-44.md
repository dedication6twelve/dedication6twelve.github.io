With day 44 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I had an active day. 10k steps, 15 minutes exercise. I was hoping to run but didn't. I will not let tomorrow pass without running! Healthy diet today, except for a muffin I had earlier in the day. (Overall I ate small quantities and healthy food.)

## Highlight of the day?

I had an opportunity to work remotely from Amsterdam today. I worked from [The Hoxton](https://thehoxton.com/holland/amsterdam/hotels), thanks to [an article that pointed out various remote work spots in the city](https://medium.com/@juanbuis/the-best-places-for-coffee-work-in-amsterdam-41027d1d55d9). It was fantastic. I was able to plug in quickly, find a small space to work, and delicious coffee. I look forward to working from other cafes mentioned in the article.

## How do I feel?

I'm feeling fine. I'm catching a cold. My throat is scratchy, and I want to always cough to dislodge an imaginary thing I think is in my throat. A little tea should help.

Tomorrow I run. That will make my day.
