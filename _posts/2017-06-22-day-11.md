With day 11 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Did well today. 10k steps, good food, feeling full and eating well is always a win!

## Highlight of the day?

I had breakfast AND lunch with a good friend and colleague who used to live in Miami but now works remotely from Tampa. It was a lot of fun to be with him and talk about the future of infrastructure and corporate IT at [PLXIS](http://plxis.com).

2nd place: spending some time with my parents over a cup of coffee in the evening.

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. Looking forward to running tomorrow and another good, strong day. One day at a time is the only way to make [#dedcation6twelve](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dedication6twelve&src=typd) work!
