With day 12 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did well today. Ran in the morning, ate well throughout the day. Was my last day in the office for a while, so I was very busy. I've always observed that being busy is good for staying healthy, in that it keeps your mind off of unhealthy food! (Note, busy does not equate to stressed. More like, occupied.)

## Highlight of the day?

EASY! Coffee with my good friends and colleagues Ariel and Megan. Megan recently joined our company, so it was a lot of fun to get to know her, all the while having Ariel's charm around us. It was a fun afternoon coffee trip. üòç

Another note, not a positive one, but a highlight none the less: a car turning almost hit me this morning while I was running. That was a little unsettling. Miami is NOT a safe place at all. Fun, but not safe. üèéÔ∏è

## How do I feel?

I feel alright. Nervous. Not feeling the project's excitement as much as I had been lately. That said, I did plot my 5k route for tomorrow, my last in the US for a while. (I do another 30-minute workout Monday, then I run in the Netherlands from Wednesday on until I get back August 10th.) I'm also proud I've stuck with the program this far. This is a great journey to be on. It makes me hyper-aware of the moment. For that I'm grateful.
