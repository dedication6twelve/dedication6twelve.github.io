With day 5 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did well. Stuck to the plan. I ran. I ate well. It was a busy day having to stay home with the kids in the morning for Bettina to run some errands in preparation for our extended stay away (six weeks in the Netherlands).

## Highlight of the day?

THIS!

Very honored by this mention.

## How do I feel?

I don't know. Today was a dull day. I'm happy to have made it through another day, but momentum wasn't as strong today. As usual, life things tear apart at my confidence to lead and my ability to inspire humility and integrity in the workplace. And this morning, when my alarm went off, for a second I considered not getting up. NOT GOOD. In these moments I try to focus on the positive. I made it through today. Tomorrow begins the weekend, and per my plan, I relax and recuperate a little bit on the food front as a reward for a solid five days. We'll see how I do...
