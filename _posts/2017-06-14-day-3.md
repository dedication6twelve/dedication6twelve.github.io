With day 3 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did well today. I got out there and ran this morning, so that's really good. Stuck to the plan. Getting my 10k steps in was easy today. And I went downtown today to support one of my teammates, who gave a presentation on the "actor model" programming paradigm. I fended off the pizza! **high five**

## Highlight of the day?

Hanging out with my buddy and seeing him present. It didn't hurt that it was in a high rise right on Biscayne Blvd with a gorgeous view out to east, where the port of Miami and South Beach sat in the distance...

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. I'm eating when I want to eat, but things that are low carb and high protein. Two days left until weekend! The weekend is good because I take a break from the high level of discipline. ðŸ¤—
