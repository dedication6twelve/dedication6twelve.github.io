With day 1 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did great. Protein bars and salad kept me afloat. Some fat free popcorn for the game tonight is all prepped. Ready to go!

## Highlight of the day?

Running this morning. I was planning on walking for 10, running for 10, and then walking for another 10 minutes. And I had my doubts about the middle 10. I was able to do the circuit with little trouble. Great start.

## How do I feel?

I feel good. I feel really good. I'm happy to finally be back on this. I hope I can see these 10 weeks through. It's crucial to do so.
