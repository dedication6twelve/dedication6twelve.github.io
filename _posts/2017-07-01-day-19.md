With day 19 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Did great! Stuck to the plan. Got my 10k steps in. Had a productive day of work despite being a quarter of a world away. I call this #winning

## Highlight of the day?

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. So happy to be here in the Netherlands. The Dutch people are lovely. And it's great to be here with Bettina's family. I'm super grateful for the opportunity.

## Bonus Video

Two-minute video on some things that make the Netherlands so nice. Enjoy.
