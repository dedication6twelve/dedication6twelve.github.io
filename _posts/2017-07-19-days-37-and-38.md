With day 37 and 38 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Did the right things - got to 10k steps day 37, did my 30 minute workout day 38. Diet choices aren't the best but aren't the worst, either.

## Highlight of the day?

Highlights are hard to come by now that I'm working again remotely.

Day 37, though, I had a lovely time feeding the ducks with the kids. Anabella LOVES birds...

Day 38 we rented some four-wheel go-kart-style pedal-powered quadricycles (for lack of a better term). They were fun.

## How do I feel?

Feeling healthy. Couldn't ask for anything more.
