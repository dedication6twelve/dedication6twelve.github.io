With day 23 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## First things first

🎆 🎇 🇺🇸 🎇 🎆 Happy 4th of July 🎆 🎇 🇺🇸 🎇 🎆 

## How did I do?

Greetings from the Gatwick Express, heading towards Victoria Station.

I did well today! I ate well. I walked a ton. And I made my flight and my journey to London without a hiccup. Well, maybe one small hiccup. Damn saucijzenbroodje is too good! But it's OK. I mostly won the day today. I refuse to kill myself over having a Dutch treat while waiting for my flight.

## Highlight of the day?

Spent time this morning in Oudewater with the children, just the kids and me while mommy shared some time with grandpa visiting her late brother's resting place. The kids were great, lots of wonderful memories. I like the opportunities I get to be with the children, just them and me. And mommy also got to do something significant. It was a highlight for many reasons.

Second place might be seeing all the London things once I landed - like Boots pharmacy or M&S grocer. Feels like I never left. :-)

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. Proper diet today. I made 10k steps, and I still have some more walking to do. Feels good to be here.

The only weird thing is that it's Independence Day today back in the US, but I'm totally not feeling it. As one might expect, nobody really cares over here. 😂 But whatever - so I don't eat a hot dog today, big deal. I celebrate in my heart the beauty of our country and how even if politicians aim to kill it as they aim to fix it, I will always hold dear what America stands for close to my heart.

On a lighter note: Tomorrow will be crucial. I need to get over hump day. Starting with a run tomorrow will be lovely. I'm thinking... Hyde Park for a proper run. 🇬🇧 🏃 😁
