With day 22 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

I did so-so. Started the day well with a run and as such easy to get to 10k steps today.

The food wasn't as great - had some bread, a banana pudding, and a couple "cafe lattes" that were sweetened. Dinner was also some ravioli at a fancy-pansy place.

But all in all, day 1 of the most stressful week of my journey is now behind me. Could have been worse.

I fly to London tomorrow.

Yikes. ðŸ˜±

## Highlight of the day?

Visiting Amsterdam, walking through its canals, enjoying the atmosphere, meeting with our most important client's representatives and my colleagues. Fantastic time, a ridiculous opportunity I have to be here. Ik ben zeer gezegend (I am very blessed).

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. It was such a nice weekend and lovely Monday. Good start to the week. Could have been better, but I'll take what I've taken for myself. (I can't help but wonder if I'm loosening up and if a lack of scale has something to do with this...)
