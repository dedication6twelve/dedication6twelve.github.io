With day 33 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Today went really well. I had a chance to run for 30 minutes, had a salad, and a protein bar. Breakfast was big, but that's OK, it was proper things and a good start of the day. The fondue for dinner wasn't great, but I'll take it.

## Highlight of the day?

My older girls finally dared the tall water slide at the park. Super fun. It started fast and dark with lots of beautiful colored lights. Then it goes pitch black before big bright arrows pointing in the other direction warn of impending doom -- or just the faint light of the opening at the end. Splash! We went multiple times. And tomorrow again!

## How do I feel?

Feeling good. Day 33 over and out. Two away from the halfway mark!
