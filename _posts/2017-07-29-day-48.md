With day 48 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

After a lovely day yesterday, I had a letdown today. No 10,000 steps. Diet was good, but after so many straight days with 10,000 steps, it feels sad not to reach it. As of this writing, I have 8,028. And it's raining and storming out, so I won't be able to complete it, even if on principle.

## Highlight of the day?

I shared a perfect time with four of the kids today. We went to [Monkey Town](https://www.monkeytown.eu/gouda) and had a blast in the indoor playground. Then we went to the [Pannekoe restaurant](http://www.pannenkoe.nl/gouda) for some [poffertjes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poffertjes). Finally, we went to the market to buy some [kibbeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeling) before heading home for the day.

## How do I feel?

Despite the excellent time with the kids, for the first time today I felt the sting of being "not home." I would love to make this place my permanent home, but while it's temporary, it will have its challenges. Living out of a suitcase for weeks, basically, isn't fun.

I'm just in a bit of a sour mood at the moment. I'll feel better tomorrow.
