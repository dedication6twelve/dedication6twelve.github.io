With day 31 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

These days are tough on the diet front. But I did run - in the cold rain, even - so I'm pleased about that. Covered 2.5 miles in 33 minutes. I'll take it! It's fun to run. My kids even made a video of me as I ran past our bungalow. (The park we're at is small enough that I could lap the place.)

## Highlight of the day?

Kids roasted marshmallows over an open fire today. Awesome!

(Note that the five on the right are mine!)

## How do I feel?

Having run today feels good. I love getting stronger on the running.

I need a scale. Need to solve for that.

Need to eat better.
