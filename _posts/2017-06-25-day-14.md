With day 14 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

It's weekend, so relaxed. I am full! We transition to the Netherlands this week so a lot of challenges await.  ut I am ready for putting in a good week this week.

## Highlight of the day?

Spending the day with my family. I enjoyed them today. :)

## How do I feel?

Feels good to have completed 14 days. Excited to get back to basics tomorrow.
