With day 17 in the books, I'm pleased to sit down and jot down a thought or two.

## How did I do?

Better today. But still, there were some food compromises I would not have made had I been in Miami. This is going to be tough.

On a brighter note, I did go for a run today and reached 10k steps. So this is very positive!

## Highlight of the day?

Visited Gouda with the kids. It was a cool, rainy afternoon. Idyllic nevertheless. There is something charming about this city that I can't quite grasp. Every time I visit, I miss it the moment I leave.

## How do I feel?

Mixed feelings. Overjoyed at being in the Netherlands. Challenged by the difficulty of maintaining any sort of rhythm, especially as the family adjusts to the new time zone. Worried about my weight (I haven't bought a scale yet over here). Just need to focus on the positive and pull out the courage to improve the things that are weak. The journey is not dead! Far from it...
